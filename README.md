# Task-3<br>
# Taking input in python:<br>
In Python, you can take input from the user using the input() function.<br>
As a parameter, we input the text we want to display to the user.<br>
Once the user presses “enter,” the input value is returned.<br>
# How to print without newline in python?<br>
In Python, you can print without a newline character by using the (end="") parameter of the print() function.<br>
By add this '\n' we get the new line so to change this behaviour we use 'end=""' to print without new line.<br>
<br>
## For example:<br>
print("Hello, world!", end="")<br>
