# Task-3<br>
# Taking input in python:<br>
In Python, you can take input from the user using the input() function.<br>
As a parameter, we input the text we want to display to the user.<br>
Once the user presses “enter,” the input value is returned.<br>
# Taking input from console:<br>
When we work on project for client.When we take the input from user by the input() function<br> but this function is not enough to print value by console.<br>
then the question is raise why the console do not print anything?<br>
This situation occurrs when the console waiting for input and the user dont to know what he<br> <br>can do know,So as a programmer you need to do for user to promot to enter some values.<br>
# Pthon|output using print() function:<br>
In python we use print() function to display text on the screen.<br>
## for example:<br>
print(“strings”): When the string is passed to the function, the string is displayed as it is.<br>We can use single quotes or double quotes, but make sure they are together.<br>
# How to print without newline in python?<br>
In Python, you can print without a newline character by using the (end="") parameter of the print() function.<br>
By add this '\n' we get the new line so to change this behaviour we use 'end=""' to print without new line.<br>
<br>
## For example:<br>
print("Hello, world!", end="")<br>
